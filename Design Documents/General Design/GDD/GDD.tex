	\section{Formal Aspects}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Type: video game (3D).
			\item Tools used: Godot, Blender, possibly Beepbox and other software.
			\item End product: browser game if stable enough (unlikely). Executable otherwise.
			\item Platforms: PC.
			\item Needed hardware: PC and usual devices (monitor, mouse, keyboard, sound system).
			\item Available languages: toki pona only (possibly with some \textit{very occasional} english).
			\item Genre: exploration, narrative, language learning, mystery, puzzle.
			\item Number of players: 1.
			\item Duration of play: a session could be as short as a few minutes or as long as it takes to complete the whole game in one sitting. The total duration of the game will depend on how many levels can be created within the time constraints of this project. Furthermore, playtests will be necessary to estimate it. There is little to no replayability.
			\item Target age group: 16+.
		\end{itemize}
	\section{Design Pillars}
		The game design must:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Go about language acquisition through \emph{exposition} and not through translation\footnote{To clarify: the game should never, ever, link a toki pona word to an english word in order to communicate its meaning. Of course, the player themself will often make that link in their head once they get the meaning of the word, but the \textit{act} of getting to that meaning should never pass through translation. For example, a fruit could be sitting near a label that reads "kili". This would lead to the player understanding that "kili" is a word that can refer to fruits. In their head, they will likely link the tooki pona word "kili" with the english word "fruit". But the game itself should not put the player in front of a text that explicitely makes that link \textit{in the game}.}.
		\item Construct the language barrier as \emph{a series of small obstacles to be overcome} and not as a list of chores to be dealt with.
		\item Encourage the player to \emph{investigate} the environment to find clues and context that allow both to understand the story and to acquire toki pona as a language.
		\item Regulate access to content based on both \emph{passive} (comprehension) and \emph{active} (expression) uses of toki pona skills.
		\item Illustrate that toki pona was developped as \emph{a language for thoughts}, and not as a tool of efficient communication. 
		\item Invite the player to reflect on some questions essential to \emph{philosophy of language}\footnote{The idea here is not to educate on specific philosophical concepts or models, but rather to put the player in an environment prone to stimulate philosophical reflection.}. 
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Design Values}
		\subsection{Experience}
			The player will:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Move through the game space. \\
				At all stages of play, they should feel:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Inquisitive
					\item Curious
					\item Immersed
				\end{itemize}
				During early stages of play, they should feel: 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Wary
					\item Disoriented
					\item Overwhelmed
					\item Intimidated
				\end{itemize}
				During late stages of play, they should feel:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Confident
					\item In control
				\end{itemize}
				\item Investigate scenes to find contextual clues\footnote{These clues might give insight about the plot (such as locket containing a portrait) or help formulate theories about toki pona and its vocabulary (such as a sign displaying a message in toki pona akin to "caution: dangerous cliff ahead" in front of said cliff). As much as possible, clues should do both at once (such as a name written in toki pona on the door of a character's room).}.\\
				At all stages of play, they should feel:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Inquisitive
					\item Curious
					\item Smart (they should not feel like they stumble on knowledge or solution to puzzles, but like they conquered it)
					\item Empathetic (the player does not have to identify with the characters or be "on their side", but they should care about each character's actions and their consequences)
					\item Rewarded (by their better understanding of the plot, a strenghtening of their toki pona skills, and by their ability to solve puzzles thanks to environmental clues)
				\end{itemize}
				During early stages of play, they should feel: 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Lost
				\end{itemize}
				During late stages of play, they should feel:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item In harmony with the environment (for example, the location of objects should make sense to them)
				\end{itemize}
				Occasionnaly, they should feel:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Various emotions towards characters (mostly: sad, angry, amused, annoyed)
					\item Intrusive (like they are snooping where they don't belong)
					\item Surprised
				\end{itemize}
				\item Read texts of various forms and types that are dispersed throughout the game space.\\
				At all stages of play, they should feel:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Eager to learn more about the story and characters
					\item Active (extracting information rather than receiving it)
				\end{itemize}
				During early stages of play, they should feel: 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Frustrated (it should be enough to motivate them to overcome the challenge posed by the reading of texts in a foreign language, but not enough to make the act of learning appear as tedious)
				\end{itemize}
				During late stages of play, they should feel:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item a
				\end{itemize}
				Occasionnaly, they should feel:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Various emotions towards characters (mostly: sad, angry, amused, annoyed)
				\end{itemize}
				\item Fill the blanks or change the words in some of the toki pona texts in order to either 1) gain access to new texts or 2) manipulate the environment\footnote{In the first case, correctly filling the text relating to an object would make a dialog appear. For example, labelling an apple as "kili" (in this context: "fruit"), would give access to the transcript of a dialog relating to said apple between two characters. In the second case, there only would be a few possible words for each changeable space, and changing them would alter the environment. For example, a locked door would initially be labeled as "lupa pini", (which can be translated as "closed door") The player could change the word "pini" (in this context: "closed") for the word "open" (in this context: "open"), resulting in the door unlocking.}.\\
				FILL HERE THE EMOTIONS THE PLAYER SHOULD FEEL.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Themes}
		EXPAND THEMES BASED ON JAVET'S PRESENTATION.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Language as a way to shape one's mind
			\item The struggle for peace through simplicity
			\item Responsibilities and how they spawn both rigidity and looseness
			\item Hubris
			\item Artificial consciousness
			\item Independance and parental control
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Point of View}
		
		\subsection{Challenges}
		The main challenges posed by the game will be the following:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Navigating the space
			\item Deducting the meaning of toki pona words based on contextual clues
			\item Using the acquired toki pona knowledge to decipher the various texts spread across the game space
			\item Using the acquired toki pona knowledge to fill the blanks in some of the texts in order either to reveal information or to manipulate the environment
			\item Connecting the available pieces of information together to uncover the wider narrative
		\end{itemize}

		\subsection{Decision-making}
		The decisions made by the player will be the following:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item What thread to investigate\\
			There are no right and wrong options for this type of decisions. Even the pursuit of a thread that is not well developped in the narrative should result in the player discovering information relating to other threads.
			\item Where to go and what to look for to investigate said thread\\
			Player can choose "wrongly" relating to this type of decisions. For example: if they investigate the death of a character that was poisoned in the dining room, going to the library is unlikely to wield any useful information.
			\item When filling blanks, what word to use\\
			There are right and wrong options for this type of decisions. While each toki pona word has a wide list of possible meanings, labeling a waterfall as a "kiwen" (which can mean things such as "hard object", "metal", "stone", "solid"), will not be validated as a good answer. There will be no consequences outside of a negative feedback (such as a trembling screen).
			\item When changing words, what word to use\\
			While there are no actual wrong options relating to this type of decisions, some words will be useful or not depanding on what the player is trying to accomplish. Trying to get a door to unlock will require to use the toki pona word "open", for example.
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Skill, strategy, chance, and uncertainty}
			There is no uncertainty and randomness that comes from the game side of the experience. The player might base some of their decisions on randomness, but the game itself should not react differently to the same series of inputs. Uncertainty will come from the learning experience. The player might be uncertain that they have correctly assessed the meaning of a toki pona word\footnote{In that regard, the game should contain many occasions for the player to test their hypothesis. The texts with blanks  fill this role, as they should give a positive feedback when correctly filled, and a negative feedback when incorrectly filled. To a lesser extent, the texts with changeable words also provide positive feedback, though it is less direct. In that case, the words won't be validated as "correct" or "incorrect", but they will result in an alteration of the environment that might match with the supposed meaning of the word - indirectly validating the hypothesis - or not match with the supposed meaning of the word - indirectly invalidating the hypothesis.}. They might also be uncertain that they have correctly interpreted the narrative. \\ 
		Strategies put in place by the player should relate to:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The acquisition of toki pona
			\item The use of toki pona
			\item The navigation of the game space
			\item The investigation of narrative elements
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Target Audience and Access}
			ijo musi is aimed at adults with previous experience of video games and an interest for toki pona. There is no need to be both an avid player and a conlang enthusiast to appreciate the game, but at least one of these two characteristics will likely be needed to enjoy the game\footnote{A rather unfortunate but essential characteristic of ijo musi is that it is not fully playable by toki pona speakers, as they already understand the language. Hopefully, the narrative will be interesting enough to provide an untertaining experience to them, but they will inevitably miss most of the gameplay that consists in the translation and acquisition of a new language.}.\\
			As such, the main way for people to hear about the game will be posts made on various forums dedicted either to toki pona or to independant game development.\\
			The game is meant to scratch an itch similar to games like \textit{Outerl Wilds}, or \textit{Return of the Obra Dinn}, although with my current skills and resources, its design will be much less efficient and its scope will be \textit{much} smaller.
		\subsection{Conditions of Play}
			ijo musi is meant to be played alone in a setting that allows for immersion (without too much outside stimulation). It is meant to be played on a computer using a keyboard and a mouse. Controller support might be added if time allows it.  
	\section{Features}
		The player character will find themself trapped in an old temple they are exploring. They will have a tool at their disposal in the form of a tablet made of a screen framed by thicker edges\footnote{The nature of the tool might change during development as technical challenges might arise.}. Clicking on a button (likely the right mouse button) will lift the tablet on front of the player camera. The camera will highlight interactive objects in a yellow, red, or green highlight. Clicking a button (likely the left mouse button) will cause the tablet screen to display an interface displaying a toki pona text representing the highlighted object. Doing so will freeze the camera and display the mouse cursor. The type of the interface will differ depending on the highlight color.\\
		For objects highlighted in yellow, some of the text's words will be changeable. To change a word, the user will click on it and either select a word from a displayed list, or type-in the word they want themselves. Only a restrained list of words will be available for each changeable word, and it will be impossible to validate the word if it is not from the available list. Once validated, the highlighted object will change to match its new 
		The features are divided into four categories: "must have", "should have", "nice to have", and "bonus".
		\subsection{Must Have Features}
			Those are the features needed for the game to run at all.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item A character that can walk and rotate in 3d space
				\item An FPS camera that can look around
				\item Collision handling for the player character, the environment, and objects
				\item A global light
				\item Low-poly 3D assests for key elements (the main tool used by the player, the walls, some furniture, some other objects)
				
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Should Have Features}
			Those are the features needed for the game to be any fun
		\subsection{Nice to Have Have Features}
			Those are the features that could transform an okay-ish game into a good one.
		\subsection{Bonus Features}
			Those are features that are shiny and appealing, but not realistic to implement within the resource constraints of the project.
